# Kit - A MakeOS Client

## Background

Kit is the official reference client of the MakeOS code collaboration protocol. 

MakeOS is a project with a goal to decentralized code hosting and sharing to allow developers 
and other collaborators build more freely without fear of censorship. 
The MakeOS project started out of a need to distribute ownership and control an
of an open source codebase that may be deployed as a service such that the users of 
the service not only co-own the codebase, but also all or part of the service.
